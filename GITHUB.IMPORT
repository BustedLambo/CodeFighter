#GITHUB.IMPORT
#--------------------------------------#

This is where I import this game into GitHub and take this idea and add it to GitHub, Where it will be downloadable and I'll try to add this to reddit if I can.
I hope you **ENJOY** :)

(Also, should I make a tutorial that will teach you how to do Python coding?)

Well, I'm gonna import this to *GitHub*

Bye :)
